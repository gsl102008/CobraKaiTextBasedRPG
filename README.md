# Overview
As a software engineer striving for continual learning and improvement, I developed this software to demonstrate my proficiency in the Java programming language. The software is a text-based RPG game written entirely in Java, showcasing various language features such as classes, objects, methods, conditionals, loops, and user input handling.

The purpose of creating this software was twofold: to deepen my understanding of Java syntax and to apply object-oriented programming principles in a practical project. Through this project, I aimed to solidify my knowledge of fundamental Java concepts while also honing my problem-solving skills by implementing game mechanics and logic.

## Development Environment
The software was developed using the following tools:

- **Java**
# Useful Websites
During the development process, the following websites were invaluable resources:

- [Oracle Java Documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/)
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
- [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/)

# Future Work
In future iterations of the project, I plan to:

- Implement additional game features such as multiple enemy types and character progression.
- Improve code modularity and readability by refactoring certain methods and classes.
- Enhance user experience by adding graphical elements or transitioning to a graphical interface.
- Incorporate unit tests to ensure code reliability and identify potential bugs.
